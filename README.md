# Very Minimal NodeJS IDE Using Visual C++
A very minimal NodeJS IDE using Visual C++. It features absolutely no auto-indent, and no text colouration. You can only type and run and was mainly designed to serve my quick-prototyping needs.

If you decide to compile it in Visual Studio 2017, be aware that you may run into issues regarding antiviruses that I have no idea how to address. It also requires you to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine since the "run" button runs terminal commands under the hood. Unless requested I will not be providing any `.exe` files of the IDE due to the previously mentioned antivirus hassle. I will try to look into ways to try and comply with AV protocols but it's not top priority at the moment.
